# PARISH SACRAMENT MONITORING SYSTEM

The proposed project aims to develop a user-friendly web-based system that empowers Catholic parishes to streamline operations, monitor sacraments, manage member information, and handle financial contributions effectively. This system is designed to bridge the gap between tradition and modernity, providing parishes with the technological tools necessary to enhance their administrative efficiency and service delivery.
